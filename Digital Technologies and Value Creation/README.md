In Digital Technologies and Value Creation course, students were assgined to complete two projects in term 1 (**group project** and **individual project**).


Firstly, the goal of group project is to collect information on competitors and prices which could help the e-commerce shop for wine open their business in new market.

```Website scraping.py``` file: I used ```BeautifulSoup``` and ```Selenium``` to collect wine's price and name from "Minibardelivery.com" which was considered to be one of the company's competitors to help company perform price analysis.

```Twitter API and sentiment analysis.ipynb```: I collected three types of tweet (one with #organic, another with #organic AND #wine and the other with #organicwine) through Twitter API to perform sentiment analysis which could help company to measure customer engagement.
