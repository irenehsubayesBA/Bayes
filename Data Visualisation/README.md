In Data Visualisation course, students were assgined to complete two projects in term 1 (group project and individual project).

Firstly, the goal of group project is to create a set of visuals to address the following business problems:

1. How do employeesâ€™ performance scores change within and across managers?

2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

3. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?

4. What are the most frequent factors for job termination?

5. Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
