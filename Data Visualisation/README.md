In Data Visualisation course, students were assgined to complete two projects in term 1 (group project and individual project).

Firstly, the goal of group project is to create a set of visuals to address the following business problems:

1. How do employeesâ€™ performance scores change within and across managers?

2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

3. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?

4. What are the most frequent factors for job termination?

5. Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?

```Data viz_group project.ipynb``` & ```Data viz_group project_2.ipynb```: I plotted four graphs by using matplotlib to answer the fifth question and second question.

Secondly, the goal of individual project is to identify a dataset of interest and perform an exploratory analysis to better understand the shape and structure of the data, investigate initial questions, and develop preliminary insights & hypotheses. The final report comprises captioned visualizations that convey key insights gained during the analysis.

In the individual project, the dataset I chose is from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales.
And the tool I used to answer the business problems I found from the dataset were **python (matplotlib)** and **Tableau**.

```Data viz_individual project.ipynb```: I plotted a graph by using matplotlib to identify the pizza's price distribution.

```Data viz_individual project_report.docx```: is the final report contaning insights gained from the visuals.
